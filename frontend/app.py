    This application uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to create
    insurance policies based on your needs. The backend is built with FastAPI and Haystack,
    and it draws information from a knowledge base of sample insurance documents.

    **To get started:**
    1. Enter a description of the policy you want in the text box below.
    2. Click the "Generate Policy" button.
    3. The system will retrieve relevant information and generate a policy.

    *(Note: The LLM generator is optional. If not configured, the app will show the documents retrieved from the knowledge base.)*
